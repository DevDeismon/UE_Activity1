# Activity 1: Jenga and Color Dice

In the first part of this activity you are asked to create a Jenga made of colored blocks, with the objective of practicing the use of materials, the inspection tool, the construction of project folders, the use of physics in a very primitive way and the construction of prefabs.

The second part consists of building a die using plans, materials and hierarchy in the history to give physics to the correct object.
